			<![CDATA[<b>Birth Order Relationships</b>

When did you arrive in your family? Are you the oldest child, a middle child, or the “baby”? Birth order may not be the most important factor in personality development, but we can make some generalizations. 

If you're the OLDEST, you're probably: 
• successful. 
• conservative.
• self-critical—always feeling you could do better.
• able to enjoy the company of older people.

Parents often expect a lot from the first child. They often push him or her to succeed. The first child often has to grow up very fast. 

If you're a MIDDLE child, you're probably:
• the one with the most friends.
• the silent rebel against the family's values.

Middle children often feel less important than their older or younger siblings. 

If you're the YOUNGEST child, you're probably:
• a show-off who enjoys the limelight.
• often the family clown, making everyone laugh. 
• both charming and a rebel—lovable one minute and breaking rules the next.
• creative in art, music, and other ways. 

The youngest child often has the longest childhood.
