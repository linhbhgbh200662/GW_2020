				<![CDATA[“A few years back, there was a delegation of employees visiting from our company’s main office in Osaka, Japan. My boss asked me to greet them at the airport, which I was happy to do since I hadn’t met anyone from Japan before. I waited for them outside the baggage area with a sign with our company’s name on it. Finally, I saw some Japanese passengers coming, and I held up my sign. There were five of them—one older man in his fifties, and four men and women who looked like they were in their thirties. They walked up to me happily and all bowed politely. So I bowed to them in return. Then, they all bowed to me again. So I bowed again. Then they bowed to me again. So I bowed back to them. I was starting to feel a little strange because I wasn’t sure when to stop bowing! Then the older man reached out and shook my hand. After that, we all reached into our pockets and pulled out our business cards. I noticed that each of them held their card with two hands and presented them to me formally, so I did the same.”
