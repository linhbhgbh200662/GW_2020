<i>Luz Rodríguez</i> 
I’m from New York, but last weekend, my husband and I went to Paris, France! It was wonderful—we did so many things. Every night, we listened to music and went to bed late. And every morning, we got up late. 

During the day, we walked the streets and visited beautiful places like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. We sat in cafes, drank coffee, and watched people. The food was great—I love French food. I loved the bread and cheese. Paris is my favorite city.

Last weekend, my friends and I went to Cancún, Mexico. Well, it was a long weekend—Thursday night to Monday night. We had a fantastic time. The beaches were just beautiful! The water was so blue and warm.

Every morning we walked on the beach, and in the evening we ate dinner in the center of the city. The food was really good—the fish and the fruit juices were so delicious. We went swimming morning, noon, and night. On Sunday we took a water taxi to Isla Mujeres.

My wife and I work in Macau. Last weekend we flew to Hong Kong. What a great city! We only had three days, but we did a little sightseeing. We took the ferry to Kowloon. We went to Aberdeen and ate dinner on a boat. We wanted to visit the Tiger Balm Garden, but there was very little time.

We mainly ate Chinese food, but sometimes we had Thai food or French food. The food in Hong Kong is terrific!]]>
