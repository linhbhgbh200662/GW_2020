<UL>
<LI>Start your day off right! Eat breakfast.

<LI>Take a piece of fruit to munch on during your commute. It tastes great, is filling, and provides energy.

<LI>Use "lite" dairy products, which are low fat and better for your health.

<LI>If you like to eat meat, trim all visible fat.

<LI>Fried foods? Snacks? Desserts? Sweets? They taste great but are not great for you. They are high in calories and can be high in fat, salt, and sugar.

<LI>Pack your own snacks of raw veggies. Buy healthy snacks like pretzels.

<LI>Cut down on portion size so you don’t eat too much unhealthy food.

<LI>Eat everything in moderation—not too much of any one thing.
