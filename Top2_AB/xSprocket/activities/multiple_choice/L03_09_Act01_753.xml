<p>I have two young children, and I’m concerned about the environmental problems our world is facing. Do you have any suggestions for ways that we can help preserve the environment?</p>

<b>Dear Wanna Be Green:</b>
There are many simple ways to keep our planet healthy. For example. here are some ways to reduce the amount of garbage or trash your family produces:
<ul>
<li>Many communities have recycling programs. If yours doesn’t, do some research. You can probably find a place to take materials to be recycled.</li>
<li>If you have a garden, then you probably have “plant trash” like grass clippings and dead leaves. Don’t throw them away. Recycle them! Sprinkle them on your lawn; those things will provide the grass with nutrients and keep it looking great.</li>
<li>You can also combine your “plant trash” and fruit and vegetable food scraps from your kitchen to make compost. The plants and food decompose and create a very rich topsoil for your garden.</li>
<li>Instead of throwing away items that you no longer use, give them away or sell them. Think of new ways to reuse items that you normally throw away.</li>
<li>Take your own bags to the store instead of getting new ones each time you shop.</li>
<li>Use e-mail instead of sending paper letters and cards. Pay your bills and read your newspaper online. Call companies that send you junk mail and get off their mailing lists.</li>
<li>Buy products made with recycled contents. A lot of things can now be made from recycled materials.</li>
</ul>

Together we can make a difference!
