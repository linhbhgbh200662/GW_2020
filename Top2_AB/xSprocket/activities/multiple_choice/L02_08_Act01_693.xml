				<![CDATA[In 1982, Lynn Contrucci bought a beautiful piece of jewelry from Mali, in West Africa. She liked the piece so much that she began to buy African art in order to understand it better. She was selling her house at the time, and she had some money to spend, so she started to collect African art. Since then, it has become a passion. She has collected nearly 300 pieces, including figures and masks. “I’m an addict now! My family thinks I’m crazy,” she jokes. Even her windows and bed are decorated with beautiful African cloth. Some pieces are given as gifts to family and friends, or they are sold just to make room for more. In 1998, she began to get interested in Chinese jade figures and Tibetan paintings. More recently, she began collecting Haitian paintings. "My home is a mixture of art from all these places,” she says. 
	
Ms. Contrucci says it is like bringing people into her home. “Each piece has a special meaning. They are my friends.”]]>
