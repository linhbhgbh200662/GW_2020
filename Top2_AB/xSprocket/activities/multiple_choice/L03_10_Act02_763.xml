				<![CDATA[<b>Ecotourism: the Promise and Perils</b>

   Worldwide, tourism generates annual revenues of nearly 3 trillion US dollars—nearly 11% of all global revenues—making it the world’s largest industry. In recent years, ecotourism—or environmentally friendly tourism—has grown in popularity, uniting the interests of both environmentalists and developers. However, finding a compromise between the environment and development is often challenging, and ecotourism can actually cause additional problems for the very regions it is supposed to protect.  

   Practically speaking, ecotourism includes activities in which visitors enjoy hands-on experiences, such as bird-watching in the Brazilian rainforest, hiking in the mountains of Nepal, participating in a traditional village celebration, or taking a canoe trip down a river. Local guides usually accompany small groups of tourists, teaching them all about local plants and animals and the culture of the region. Tourists typically stay with local families, or at small, environmentally friendly hotels. The cross-cultural exchange that is part of the experience adds greatly to its value for many people. Ecotourism also encourages the development of native handicrafts and artwork for souvenirs, and thus contributes to the preservation of cultural heritage. 

   Ecotourism presents an alternative to traditional approaches to economic development, such as farming, logging, mining, or hunting. It offers people the change to escape a cycle of poverty and, by sharing their knowledge of the local terrain and ecology with visitors, to develop a stronger sense of community pride. 

   However, ecotourism is not always beneficial to local people and the ecology. Any increase in population, however temporary, produces larger amounts of waste and pollution and can require more development. Tourist overcrowding is causing severe environmental damage to the Galapagos Islands, for example. Tourists who go to view wildlife can scare animals away from their feeding and nesting sites. Tourism may even encourage the development of markets in wildlife souvenirs (skins, bones, etc.), which further damages the environment.]]>
