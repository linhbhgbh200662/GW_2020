				<![CDATA[Every morning, Mike Nesi gets up early and gets dressed before 7:00 AM. He brushes his teeth, combs his hair, and shaves. Then he makes breakfast. Before he goes to work, he takes out the garbage and he checks e-mail. Then he takes the bus to work.  

His wife, Susan, gets up after 7:00 and eats breakfast. She exercises and listens to music. Then she takes a shower and she puts on her makeup. Before she goes to work, she washes the dishes. Then she walks to work. 

When Mike and Susan come home, they make dinner and watch TV. Sometimes they read or they do the laundry. Then they get undressed and they go to bed. 

On the weekend, they always go shopping and clean the house. On Saturdays, Mike sometimes plays soccer. In the evening, they go out for dinner. Sometimes they go to the movies or visit friends. ]]>
