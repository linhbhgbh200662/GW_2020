				<![CDATA[“About three years ago, I met a woman from Iran named Leila Bahrami. She was working at the Iranian consulate in Milan and we got to know each other a little because she ordered office supplies from my company. One day, she told me that her husband, Sayed, needed some supplies for his business. She asked if I could help. Of course, I agreed and made plans to meet her husband at my office the next day. At about noon, he arrived wearing a dark suit with a traditional Iranian collar and he had a beard. In Italy, we shake hands when we meet people for the first time, so I extended my hand to greet him. But he looked uncomfortable and explained that it was against his country’s customs for a man to shake a woman’s hand. He apologized and explained that he didn’t mean to offend me. I was a little surprised, but I apologized, too. He was actually very nice and I was able to help him get what he needed.”
