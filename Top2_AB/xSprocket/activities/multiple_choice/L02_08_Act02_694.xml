				<![CDATA[Yu Gan is an artist from a family of talented artists. He began painting at the age of seven and never stopped. His father, Yu Heng, is known internationally for his dramatic traditional paintings, calligraphy, and poetry. His brother, Yu Ping, is a sculptor and painter. His sister, Yu Fan, is both a pianist and an artist. His wife, Yan Liu, is a fashion designer, and his son, Kuai—who has shown strong artistic talent since the age of three—wants to be a filmmaker. 
    
Mr. Yu paints in an abstract style that combines, as he puts it, “the best traditions of Western and Eastern art.” Like traditional Chinese artists, he is inspired by images from nature—earth and water. Like Western artists, he works with oil paint to express his feelings. He hopes to influence young Chinese with his art. “Today, they turn away from all things Chinese and love all things Western. I want them to understand that they can take the best from both worlds.” 
    
“I am totally captivated by art,” says Mr. Yu. “I can’t imagine life without it.”]]>
