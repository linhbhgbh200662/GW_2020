			<![CDATA[<b>Birth Order Relationships</b>

When did you arrive in your family? Are you the oldest child, a middle child, or the “baby”? Birth order may not be the most important factor in personality development, but we can make some generalizations. 
If you're the <b>OLDEST</b>, you're probably: 
   • successful. 
   • conservative.
   • self-critical—always feeling you could do better.
   • able to enjoy the company of older people.
Parents often expect a lot from the first child. They often push him or her to succeed. The first child often has to grow up very fast. 

If you're a <b>MIDDLE</b> child, you're probably:
   • the one with the most friends.
   • the silent rebel against the family's values.
Middle children often feel less important than their older or younger siblings. 

If you're the <b>YOUNGEST</b> child, you're probably:
   • a show-off who enjoys the limelight.
   • often the family clown, making everyone laugh. 
   • both charming and a rebel—lovable one minute and breaking rules the next.
   • creative in art, music, and other ways. 
The youngest child often has the longest childhood.]]>
