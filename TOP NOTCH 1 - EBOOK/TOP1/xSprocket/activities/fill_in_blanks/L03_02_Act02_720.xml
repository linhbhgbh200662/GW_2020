<b>Before you go...</b>
A checklist for international travelers

<u>Vaccinations</u>
You may be required to get vaccinated before you are allowed to enter certain countries. Check the immunization requirements of the country you are visiting. The farther off the beaten path you travel, the more important it is to be protected from illness and disease.

<u>Medications</u>
Talk to your doctor before your trip. Your doctor may be able to write a prescription for extra medication or give you tips for staying healthy while traveling. Buy and pack a supply of all medications you take regularly. Carry your medications in your carry-on bags. If you lose your luggage, you will still have them. 

<u>Eyewear</u>
If you wear glasses or contact lenses, get a copy of your prescription before you go.  Carry it with you in case you break or lose your eyewear. Or be sure to carry an extra pair with you. 

<u>Dental care</u>
There’s nothing more frightening than having a toothache when you’re far from home. Have a dental check-up before you leave on a long trip to avoid any problems.]]>
