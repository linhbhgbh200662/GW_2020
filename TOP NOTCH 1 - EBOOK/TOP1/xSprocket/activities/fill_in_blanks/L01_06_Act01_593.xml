			<![CDATA[<b>With her mother’s help, Brooke Ellison remains active</b>
	Brooke Ellison graduated from Harvard University, and now she is continuing her studies as a full-time graduate student. Brooke is a quadriplegic—she can’t move her arms or legs. She spends all her time in a wheelchair, and she can’t breathe without a special machine. A terrible accident at the age of 11 changed her life—she was hit by a car on her way home from school. But she stays active every day.
	On a typical morning, it takes most people about a half hour to get up, get dressed, and have breakfast. For Brooke, it usually takes about four hours. Her mother, Jean, wakes her early in the morning and exercises her arms and legs. Then she gives her a bath, combs her hair, and brushes her teeth. After that, she dresses her and lifts her into her wheelchair. By late morning, Brooke is ready for breakfast. In the afternoon, Brooke goes to her classes and listens carefully. Her mother goes to classes with her and takes notes. For a lot of activities, such as using a calculator, Brooke uses her mouth, instead of her hands and legs. She can move her wheelchair by blowing into a tube. 
	At night, she does her homework and reads her e-mail, and she often phones her brother or sister to talk. To use a computer, she uses her voice—she tells the computer what to do. At about 8:00, she gets ready for bed—it usually takes about two hours. Her mother undresses her, bathes her, and exercises her arms and legs again. 
	When she can, Brook gives speeches to young people. She tells them about her life and teaches them to always be active.]]>
