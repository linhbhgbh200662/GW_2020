			<![CDATA[<b>Thor Heyerdahl, Explorer</b>
Thor Heyerdahl was born in Norway in 1914. Heyerdahl got married in 1937. He and his wife, Liv, moved to Polynesia that year. While they lived there, Heyerdahl liked to go fishing. When he went fishing, he studied the wind and the Pacific Ocean currents. 
	In 1947, people thought that the first Polynesians had come from the west, from Southeast Asia. Because of the winds and the ocean currents, Heyerdahl had a different idea. He thought the first Polynesians had come from the east.
	In 1947, Heyerdahl made the Kon-Tiki, a raft of balsa wood. With a crew of men from many countries, he traveled 8000 kilometers [4300 miles] from Callao, Peru to Polynesia. The voyage of the Kon-Tiki was very difficult. It took 101 days. But it proved that Heyerdahl’s idea was possible. Heyerdahl died in 2002.]]>
