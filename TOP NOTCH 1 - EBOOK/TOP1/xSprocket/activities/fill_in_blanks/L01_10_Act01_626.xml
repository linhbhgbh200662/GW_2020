<b>Traveler’s checks</b>
The easiest and safest way to carry money in Canada is in traveler’s checks. If you lose them—or if someone steals them—they can be replaced. 

<b>Credit cards</b>
You can use credit cards at most stores and restaurants. However, some smaller businesses don’t accept them. Make sure you always carry some cash. 

<b>Changing money</b>
Banks usually offer the best exchange rates. Remember to bring your passport for identification.

<b>ATMs</b>
Get cash 24 hours a day from ATMs (called bank machines in Canada) at banks, bus and train stations, and large supermarkets.

<b>Tipping</b>
Leave a tip of about 10 to 15% of a restaurant bill or taxi fare. Restaurant bills for larger groups may include a service charge. Also tip hairdressers and hotel staff. 

<b>Bargaining</b>
While shopping in Toronto, it’s generally not the custom to bargain for a lower price.]]>
