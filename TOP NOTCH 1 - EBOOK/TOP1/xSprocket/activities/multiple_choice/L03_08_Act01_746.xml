The old saying “beauty is pain” might not be so true anymore.

Welcome a new invention to the fashion world: a high heel that changes into a flat shoe in less than 2 seconds.

The creation is the idea of Ella Kilgour, who studied product design. Before now, Ella had designed toys, furniture, and handbags, but never shoes. 

The idea came to her one night after she walked home in a pair of high heels. Her feet hurt badly, so she decided to design a pair of attractive, but comfortable, high heels.

After 9 months of research, Ella created her design. The shoes are made of leather, with a flexible bottom and an aluminum heel. The design is actually pretty low-tech. To change the shoe from high to flat, you just pull the heel down and flip it under the shoe. The heel clicks into place, which led to its name, Declic. In seconds the shoe goes from 10 cm high to 3 cm.

Ella agrees that high-heeled shoes are impractical and uncomfortable, but points out that many women like how they look. She says she’s giving women what they want: high heels that turn into flat shoes when the party’s over.]]>
