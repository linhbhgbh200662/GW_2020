				<![CDATA[Today is Monday. The weather is cold. David is a writer. He works at home. Today he’s getting up early because he’s making lunch for his four children before school. He’s also making breakfast for his wife, Laura.  Laura’s going to work at 8:00, and she needs breakfast early, too. David and Laura give the children their warm sweaters and jackets and their lunches for school. After Laura goes to work and the children go to school, David does all his Monday chores: he does the laundry, takes out Saturday and Sunday’s garbage, and goes shopping. David does his chores fast, because today he’s starting work on a new book. The book is about his life.]]>
