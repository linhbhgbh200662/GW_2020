				<![CDATA[<b>On a Budget?
Here are some alternatives to hotels.</b>

<b>Have you thought about a hostel?</b>
Hostels provide convenient, low-cost accommodations for travelers. Hostels are clean, safe, and inexpensive. They usually have great locations—right in the heart of the city, or just outside of town. Most hostels offer fully equipped self-serve kitchens, dining areas, and common rooms for relaxing and socializing with other travelers. Some hostels even have laundry facilities and libraries. 

<b>A bed & breakfast might be for you.</b>
A bed & breakfast, also called a “B&B,” can be a home away from home when you travel. Because this type of accommodation is almost always in a private house, it usually offers a very warm, welcoming atmosphere. A good host will leave you feeling part of the family! As a guest, you get a clean, cozy room, and, as the name suggests, breakfast is included. B&Bs can be a great deal!

<b>How about camping under the stars?</b>
At a campground, you spend the night outdoors, sleeping in a tent or cabin and cooking over a wood fire or camp stove. Many campgrounds are located in beautiful parks or other natural areas. Most campsites offer only basic services such as hot showers and flush toilets although some also provide electricity and laundry facilities. While camping may not be the most comfortable way to spend the night, it’s usually the most economical. And you can’t beat the views!]]>
