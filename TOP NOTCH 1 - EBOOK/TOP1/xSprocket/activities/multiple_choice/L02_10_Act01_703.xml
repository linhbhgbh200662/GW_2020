TOKYO—If it can be lost on the streets of Tokyo, it can be found in the city’s cavernous lost-and-found center, where everything from diamond rings to dentures and millions of dollars in stray cash await their rightful, if forgetful, owners. On any given day, about 800,000 items pack the four-story warehouse, with 5,000 new ones trucked in every morning for an annual total that includes 220,000 articles of clothing, 30,000 cell phones, 18,000 eyeglasses, and 17,000 wallets.

“I’m not surprised anymore by what people lose,” says lost-and-found manager Nobuo Hasuda as he walks along the paths between wheelchairs, snowshoes, motorcycle helmets, and trumpets. There are file cabinets labeled “Cell Phones: April,” “Wallets: March,” and “Eyeglasses: February.”

Last year, about 1.62 million articles passed through the center, making it possibly the world’s biggest lost-and-found. About 250 hopefuls visit each day to see if their lost keys, briefcases, and wallets are there.

Typical of a country obsessed with order and detail, every item is scrupulously labeled with time and place of recovery, then computer archived — no matter how seemingly trivial. One Good Samaritan turned in a phone card worth only 42 cents. It’s now tagged and waiting in a drawer cluttered with half-used train passes.]]>
