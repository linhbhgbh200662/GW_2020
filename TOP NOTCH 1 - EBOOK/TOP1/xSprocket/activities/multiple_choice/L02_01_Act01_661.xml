				<![CDATA[“Years ago, I went to Uruguay on vacation and I contacted an old friend of mine from college who was recently married. He and his wife invited me to their home for lunch. In my own country, I’m accustomed to shaking hands when I meet both men and women for the first time, but in Uruguay men and women often kiss each other on the cheek, except in very formal situations. But I wanted to follow the local customs. The only problem was that in some countries, you kiss once, in some, twice, and in others, three times! So it can be pretty confusing. We met on the street outside the restaurant and I shook my friend’s hand. When he introduced me to his wife, we both leaned over to kiss each other on the cheek. She stopped after one kiss, but I continued to give her a kiss on the other cheek. Her husband laughed and joked, 'Peter, once is enough!' It was a little embarrassing, but we all laughed about it.”
