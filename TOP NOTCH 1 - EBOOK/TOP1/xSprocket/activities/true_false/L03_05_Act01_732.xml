		<![CDATA[<b>An Amazing Story of Survival</b> 

   In August of 1914, Irish-born explorer Ernest Shackleton and twenty-seven men began a journey across Antarctica. But the journey soon became a disaster, and the men had to fight for survival. 
  	
   In January 1915, the ice of the Weddell Sea closed around Shackleton’s boat, <i>Endurance</i>. Because the ship was completely frozen in the ice, the men had to wait for the ice to melt before they could continue on their journey. But after ten months, there was an emergency: the ship was being crushed by the ice and was starting to sink. The men escaped with three lifeboats and spent the next five months living on a large piece of ice. They didn’t have many supplies, so they ate penguins and made fire by burning fat from seals. 
  	
   When the men were finally able to leave, they sailed on the lifeboats through freezing, stormy water to solid land, which they soon learned was a deserted island. Since this deserted island had no supplies, Shackleton and five of his men left the island in a tiny lifeboat and traveled 1280 kilometers through freezing water with waves over eighteen meters high. After a month, they finally arrived at a second island. Shackleton and his men almost died trying to cross the mountains on this island. 
  	
   Luckily, three days later they found signs of civilization, and they organized a rescue for the rest of the men on the first island. Amazingly, all of the men arrived home safely. This is a true story of survival.]]>
